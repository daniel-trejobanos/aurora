AURORA (from Air pollUtion souRces tO moRtAlity)

## Description

## Visuals

## Installation
Within a particular  ecosystem, there may be a common  way of installing things,
such as using  Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider  the possibility that
whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
specific steps helps  remove ambiguity and gets people to  using your project as
quickly as  possible. If it  only runs in a  specific context like  a particular
programming language version  or operating system or has  dependencies that have
to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
