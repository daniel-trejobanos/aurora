BIN2ASC and ASC2BIN conversion programs (9/14/06)
-------------------------------------------------

The BIN2ASC program provides a simple way to convert
CAMx Fortran binary gridded output files (UAM format)
to a formatted ASCII text format.  The ASC2BIN program
converts the opposite direction.  The program code
can also serve as a reference to the binary read/write
formats and orders of all the variables on file.

Usage is simple:
1) Compile the programs using the included makefile
   by simply entering the command: make. This makefile
   is for the Portlans Group compiler. You will have to
   modify the makefile to use it with another compiler.
2) Run the program at a shell prompt.
3) Follow the instructions on the screen to enter
   input/output file paths/names.

The program automatically determines the type of
file according to the file keyword that is written
as the first variable on file.  The program is
F77, so you may need to increase the dimension parameters
if the program warns you of a problem.  Simply edit
the values of dimension parameters and re-compile.
